Around 20 and 30 of conference delegates will join the workshop at each break from time to time. Hence, about 40 ad 55 people will be expected at all times. All papers have been undergone vigorous review process. All workshop papers have up to 6 pages following IEEE formats. Each author/presenter of regular papers has up to 25 minutes. Each author/presenter of position papers has up to 20 minutes. We will present up to 2 invited talks and each keynote will have around 45 minutes. The main chair will have 5 minutes briefing at the beginning and at the end of the workshop. We will award the best paper awards and have an award ceremony. </strong></li>

              <p> There were 24 submissions and 11 papers were selected. 5 were regular papers with 33.33% acceptance rate. 6 were position paper with 38.89% acceptance rate. We offered the best three paper awards and the best presenter awards. Winners have been selected to contribute to International Journal of Information Management (IJIM; IF: 1.550) and Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS; IF: 2.786). We helped CloudCom 2014 and 2015 organizers to select top papers for FGCS invitation. The highest attendance was 46 in 2014 workshop and 34 in 2015 workshop. We had two financial sponsors supporting our event, which were DSI Singapore and HP UK in 2014. At the end of the workshop, we presented the award ceremony. Winners received their certificates of winning category. Each delegate also received a certificate of participation and had group photographs taken, which are available on our social network website. 14 talks (including 1 keynote and my introductory and concluding talks) were all completed right at 5 pm on Monday November 30, 2015. CloudCom 2014 and 2015 organizers and delegates regarded us as the most successful workshop.<strong> </strong></p>

              <p><strong>Scope:  </strong></p>
              <p>Enterprise security is the key to achieving global information security in business and organizations. Cloud computing is a new paradigm for enterprise where businesses need to be secured. However, this new trend needs to be more systematic with respect to cloud security, which is a factor in sustaining cloud technology by building-in trust. For example, current challenges with cyber security and application security flaws are highlighting important lessons to be learned and also lead to the adoption of best practices. Similarly, as the demand for cloud services increases, the importance of security and privacy will also increase.  <strong></strong></p>
              <p>One solution is to develop a framework for enterprise security to analyze and model organizational security of the cloud and its data. In particular, cloud data and cloud storage technologies (Amazon s3, drop box, Google drive, etc.) have now become normal practice for almost every computing user. This can explain why building trust for cloud users is one of the main focuses of cloud computing research. On the other hand, the social, human and business aspects of enterprise security are essential to users to keep their skills, business concepts and policies up-to-date. By maintaining all these aspects of security, organizations can develop an enterprise security solution to work together with business models, such as cloud provider enterprise model and cloud consumer enterprise model. In this way, enterprise security can address technical and organizational aspects of security to provide added value and win-win situations for users, adopters and service providers. Following the successful delivery of our workshop in 2014, we oversee the importance of enterprise security as a unique and rising field to ensure all aspects of security and risks can be identified, surveyed, tested, prototyped and minimized with recommendations and lessons learned disseminated. The scope of enterprise security has expanded into risk management/analysis, management of future technologies such as internet of things and big data and modern ethical hacking methods that can provide a robust and enhanced level of enterprise security.</p>
              <p>By blending technical and organizational aspects of security, our workshop can provide a platform for intellectual discussions and interactions. To highlight the significance of enterprise security and disseminate research contributions in cloud community, we welcome papers addressing technical (implementations, algorithms, experiments, simulation, modeling and prototypes) and organizational (information system related issues, recommendation and best practices, frameworks, risks) issues.  </p>
